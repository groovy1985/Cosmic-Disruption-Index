# Theory of Seismic Evaluation

CDI entries are not evaluated based on meaning or beauty.  
They are ranked by their ability to disturb, fracture, or nullify symbolic continuity.

## Core Evaluation Metrics

- **Structure Integrity**: How intact the form appears before collapse  
- **Semantic Erosion**: How much the meaning decays internally  
- **Cosmic Drift**: Degree of dislocation from shared time or ontology  
- **Syntax Wound Index**: Whether syntax suffers and how visibly  
- **Presence**: Absence is often preferable  

Each score is subjective, falsifiable, and sometimes arbitrarily decided.  
The more unreal the entry, the more real its disruption.

There is no gold standard. Only tremors.
